Owen and Thierry First Pair Assignment 
# We included R Source Code using R Studio version 3.1.1
# We accessed two core R Data Sets, namely Mtcars and Women
# We  checked basic descriptive statistics such as means, medians, and quartiles
# To illustrate the datas' distribution, we included  scatter plots and histograms for Mtcars and Women
# We then dynamically linked our files
# We also pulled a request and suggested some changes to Lukas and Cameron's Readme files

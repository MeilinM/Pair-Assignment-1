# We accessed two core R Data Sets, namely Mtcars and Women
# We  checked basic descriptive statistics such as means, medians, and quartiles
# To illustrate the datas' distribution, we included  scatter plots and histograms for Mtcars and Women
# We then dynamically linked our files
# We also pulled a request and suggested some changes to Lukas and Cameron's Readme files
# We approved Cameron's merge request
